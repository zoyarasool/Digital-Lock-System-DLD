# Digital Lock System (DLD Project)

## Overview
This project is a **Digital Lock System** designed using **Digital Logic Design (DLD)** concepts and implemented on **CircuitVerse**.  
The system verifies a predefined password and indicates whether the entered password is correct or incorrect.

## Features
- Password matching using logic gates
- Correct and incorrect password indication
- Counter to track attempts
- Fully combinational & sequential logic based design
- No microcontroller or software dependency

## Concepts Used
- Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT)
- Multiplexers & Decoders
- Boolean Algebra
- Counters
- Combinational & Sequential Circuits

## Tools & Technologies
- CircuitVerse
- Digital Logic Design (DLD)
